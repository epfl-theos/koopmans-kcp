@title@   Empty states
==============================================================================
 
  The aim of this test is to show how to compute empty states using cp
  w/ or w/o  orbital density dependent potentials.

  The calculations work in the following way:
  - first a normal cp calculation is performed in order to reach
    a decent description of the GS properties

  - then, additional empty states are included in the minimization.
    the occupied orbitals are not changed, while the unoccupied ones
    are kept orthogonal to the first set. The unoccupied ones are
    minimized as if their occupations were non-zero.

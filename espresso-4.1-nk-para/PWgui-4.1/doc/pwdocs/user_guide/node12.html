2.5 Running examples</A>
</H2>

<P>
As a final check that compilation was successful, you may want to run some or
all of the examples contained within the examples directory of the 
Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO distribution. Those examples try to exercise all the programs
and features of the Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO distribution. A list of examples and
of what each example does is contained in examples/README. For details,
see the README file in each example's directory. If you find that any relevant
feature isn't being tested, please contact us (or even better, write and send
us a new example yourself !).

<P>
To run the examples, you should follow this procedure:

<P>
1. Go to the examples directory and edit the environment variables
   file, setting the following variables as needed: 
<PRE>
   BIN_DIR= directory where executables reside
   PSEUDO_DIR= directory where pseudopotential files reside
   TMP_DIR= directory to be used as temporary storage area
</PRE>
If you have downloaded the full Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO distribution, you may set 
BIN_DIR=$TOPDIR/bin and PSEUDO_DIR=$TOPDIR/pseudo, where =$TOPDIR
is the root of the Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO source tree. In order to be able
to run all the examples, the PSEUDO_DIR directory must contain all the
needed pseudopotentials. 
If any of these are missing, you can download them (and many others)
from the Pseudopotentials Page of the Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO web site
(http://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudo.php). TMP_DIR must be a
directory you 
have read and write access to, with enough available space to host the
temporary files produced by the example runs, and possibly offering
high I/O performance (i.e., don't use an NFS-mounted directory). 

<P>
2. If you have compiled the parallel version of Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO (this
is the default if parallel libraries are detected), you will usually
have to specify a driver program (such as poe or mpiexec) and the
number of processors: see section ''Running on parallel machines' for
details. In order to do that, edit again the environment variables file
and set the PARA_PREFIX and PARA_POSTFIX variables as needed. Parallel
executables will be run by a command like this: 
<PRE>
      $PARA_PREFIX pw.x $PARA_POSTFIX &lt; file.in &gt; file.out
</PRE>
For example, if the command line is like this (as for an IBM SP):
<PRE>
      poe pw.x -procs 4 &lt; file.in &gt; file.out
</PRE>
you should set PARA_PREFIX="poe", PARA_POSTFIX="-procs
4". Furthermore, if your machine does not support interactive use, you
must run the commands specified below through the batch queueing
system installed on that machine. Ask your system administrator for
instructions. 

<P>
3. To run a single example, go to the corresponding directory (for
   instance, example/example01) and execute: 
<PRE>
      ./run_example
</PRE>
This will create a subdirectory results, containing the input and
output files generated by the calculation. Some examples take only a
few seconds to run, while others may require several minutes depending
on your system. To run all the examples in one go, execute:
<PRE>
      ./run_all_examples
</PRE>
from the examples directory. On a single-processor machine, this
typically takes a few hours. The make_clean script cleans the
examples tree, by removing all the results subdirectories. However, if
additional subdirectories have been created, they aren't deleted. 

<P>
4. In each example's directory, the reference subdirectory contains
verified output files, that you can check your results against. They
were generated on a Linux PC using the Intel compiler. On different
architectures the precise numbers could be slightly different, in
particular if different FFT dimensions are automatically selected. For
this reason, a plain diff of your results against the reference data
doesn't work, or at least, it requires human inspection of the
results. Instead, you can run the  
check_example script in the examples directory:
<PRE>
      ./check_example example_dir
</PRE>
where example dir is the directory of the example that you want to
check (e.g., ./check_example example01). You can specify multiple
directories.  

<P>
<EM>Note</EM>: check_example does only a fair job, and only for a few examples. 
For pw.x only, a much better series of automated tests is available in
directory tests/. Edit variables PARA_PREFIX, PARA_POSTFIX (if
needed) in file "check_pw.x.j"; explanations on how to run it 
are in the header of the file.
